		<h3>Stickers</h3>
		<br>
		<p>For the stickers, I started with this <i>horrible</i> design, then used CorelDraw X7 and fitted it to a star shape.</p>
		<p>After I had set up the cut lines, I sent them to the machine, which printed and cut them out.  Here's the final product</p>

		<h3>Decals</h3>
		<br>
		<p>For the vinyl decals, I took this batman beyond silhouette, made it solid black, and removed the white background.</p>
		<img src="BB.png" height="300px">
		<p>After I had done that, the rest was easy.  The vinyl cutter neatly cut them out, and all that was left was to remove the unwanted parts of the decal and apply them.</p>

		<h3>Using the Makerbots</h3>

		<br>
		<h3>Pi Box</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Next, I had to print out the Raspberry Pi box we made week 2</p>
		<p>The first print was very close, but the USB ports on the front didn't quite fit.</p>
		<p>After a second print with minor tweaking, the Pi fit into my case quite well.</p>

		<h3>Dodecahedron</h3>
		<br>
		<p>To print something that couldn't be made subtractively, I decided to make a hollow dodecahedron.</p>
		<img src="Dodecahedron.png">
		<p>After designing the piece in Solidworks, I sent it to the Makerbot to be printed.  Here's the final product.</p>

		<h3>Me</h3>
		<br>
		<p>The next thing to do was to print a 3D scaned object.  So I had Marc scan my face, and (after a couple of tries) we got a good scan.</p>
		
		<p>After removing some of the holes and making the scan solid, I sent it to the printer</p>

		<h3>Box</h3>
		<br>
		<p>To make a cardboard box, we used an online program called makercase (found <a href="http://www.makercase.com/">here</a>)</p>
		<p>I downloaded the custom case plans, and sent them to the laser cutter.</p>
		<p>After a few failed attemps, I managed to use the laser cutter to cut the case plans out of cardboard, and assembled them.  Here is the final product.</p>

		<h3>Stamp</h3>
		<br>
		<p>For my stamp, I made a simple design in CorelDraw X7, and used the laser cutter to engrave the mirrored, inverted design into a peice of rubber</p>
		<p>After I had done that, the only step left was to mount it and test it</p>
		<img src="Stamp1.jpg" height="300px">
		<br>
		<h3>Pencil Case</h3>
		<br>
		<p>For a laser cut design featuring a living hinge, I decided to make a pencil case.  I drew a design in CorelDraw X7, and sent it to the printer</p>
		<p>After doing a test cut on cardboard, I made a few adjustments and cut it out of black foamcore</p>
		<img src="Case4.jpg" height="300px">
		<p>When I had the cut peices, I assembled them into a finished product</p>

		<h3>Water Bottle</h3>
		<br>
		<p>For my water bottle, I decided to make yet another piece of Eastern Reserve paraphernalia.  So I took the logo from my phone case, and put it into a CorelDraw X7 file.</p>
		<p>After hooking up the rotary machine in the laser cutter, I lined up my water bottle and started the engraving</p>

		<h3>Phone Case</h3>
		<br>
		<p>For my phone case, i started by designing the "Eastern Reserve Academy" logo.</p>
		<img src="ERA.png" style="width:500 px; height:400px">
		<p>I then 3D printed a phone case for my phone (found on thingiverse <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1412951/#files">here</a>).</p>

		<p>After I had my printed phone case, I loaded it into the UV printer, and started the print</p>

		<h3>T-Shirt</h3>
		<br>
		<p>I decided to stick with the Eastern Reserve Academy theme, and make a T-shirt.<br>I made a new design and started printing</p>
		<img src="" alt="ERA T-Shirt">
		<p>The first attempt at printing failed (the shirt wasn't flat on the platen), so I tried it again</p>
		<img src="Shirt1.jpg" alt="T-Shirt" height="300px">
		<p>and it worked!</p>

		<h3>Pi Box</h3>
		<br>
		<p>For the Pi Box, I started by taking measurments of the actual raspberry pi.  After I had those, I went into Fusion 360 and started modeling</p>
		<p> First I made the bottom of the box, the extruded the walls.</p>
		<p>After adding a roof for the box, I cut holes in the sides for the various ports on the pi.</p>
		<p>Finally, I cut the box into two pieces, and seperated them.</p>

		<h3>Design Challenge</h3>
		<br>
		<p>For the design challenge, we were given spaghetti and tape, and challenged to make the tallest structure that could support a marshmellow.</p>
		<p>After a brief planning session, the team got to work, starting with a good pyramid base, and building off of that.  Unfortunatly, we didn't plan much past the bottom half of our tower, and the top half could barely support the marshmellow</p>
		<p>If we were to do this again, I would more carefully plan the tower, and make sure it was not topheavy</p>
